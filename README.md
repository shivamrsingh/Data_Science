# Credit Card Fraudulent 

This project involves data analysis and visualization using Python, MATLAB, and Seaborn. The data is filtered to remove all null values, and a train-test split method is used to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms. 
The model's accuracy is then tested and evaluated.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the data preprocessing script:
    ```
    python zappy.ipynb
    ```

2. Visualize the data:
    ```
    python zappy.ipynb
    ```

3. Train and test the model:
    ```python zappy.ipynb
    ```

## Data Preprocessing

- Load the dataset.
- Remove all null values.
- Save the cleaned data to `zappy_loan.csv`.

## Visualization

- Use MATLAB and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Generate plots to understand data distribution and relationships.

## Model Training and Testing

- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the machine learning model using the training set.
- Test the model using the testing set.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Results

- The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
- Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `zappy.ipynb` notebook.
